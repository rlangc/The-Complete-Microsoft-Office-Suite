# Basic Note-Taking and Formatting in OneNote

This guide teaches how to take notes and apply basic formatting to create clean, readable, and well-structured content in OneNote.

## Entering Notes

- Click anywhere on a page to begin typing.
- Use Tab and Enter to create indented lists and paragraphs.
- Move text boxes freely around the page for visual organization.

## Formatting Tools

- Font type, size, color, and highlighting from the Home tab.
- Use headings (Heading 1, 2, 3) for structure.
- Bulleted lists, numbered lists, and checkboxes for lists and tasks.

## Using Checklists

- Great for task lists and action items.
- Toggle checkboxes to mark tasks as complete.
- Combine with tags for additional tracking.

## Undo and Redo

- Undo (Ctrl + Z) and Redo (Ctrl + Y) for quick changes.

Proper formatting enhances clarity and makes notes easier to reference later, especially in collaborative environments.
