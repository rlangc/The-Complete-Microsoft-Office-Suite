## Microsoft Teams

This section provides a comprehensive walkthrough of Microsoft Teams and its suite of integrated collaboration tools, guiding users from foundational concepts to advanced team-based workflows. It begins with the basics of navigating the Teams interface, creating and joining teams and channels, initiating chats, and scheduling or joining meetings. It also covers file sharing, co-authoring documents in real time, and essential communication features designed for remote and hybrid work environments.

As users grow more proficient, the section introduces techniques for managing teams at scale, including the use of private and shared channels, custom tabs, and meeting enhancements such as breakout rooms, live polls, and digital whiteboards. Integration with other Microsoft 365 tools—like Outlook, OneDrive, and OneNote—is also explored to help users streamline collaboration and centralize communication.

At the advanced level, users learn to automate workflows using Power Automate, deploy bots to assist with routine tasks, and configure custom apps and connectors that expand functionality and tailor Teams to organizational needs. Security and compliance features such as data loss prevention, guest access management, and role-based permissions are also covered to support enterprise deployment.

Whether you're using Teams for casual team check-ins or large-scale project collaboration, this section equips you with the knowledge and tools to maximize productivity, improve team communication, and create a connected digital workspace that scales with your needs.
