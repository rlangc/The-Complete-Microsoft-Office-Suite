## Tips for Efficient Navigation

- Use the number keys (`Ctrl + 1` to `Ctrl + 6`) to jump between major sections.
- The command box (`Ctrl + /`) provides a list of fast-access actions.
- You can search by keyword or phrase to find messages, people, or files.
- Use quotation marks for exact matches: `"project status report"`
- Use filters after searching to narrow results by message, file type, or person.
