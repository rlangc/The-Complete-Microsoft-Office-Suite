# Share Slides in Microsoft Teams Meetings with PowerPoint Live

## Overview  
PowerPoint Live enhances presentation capabilities in Teams by enabling smooth presenter control, audience interactivity, and accessible features like screen readers and live translations. It offers a professional alternative to standard screen sharing. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### Benefits of PowerPoint Live  
- Multiple presenters can control the slide deck seamlessly. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Presenter view shows notes, content navigation, and audience feedback simultaneously. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- High accessibility: screen reader compatibility, live translations, and high-contrast mode. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Audience engagement: attendees can navigate slides independently (if enabled), access embedded links, and view videos. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

## Step-by-Step: Presenter Setup

1. Join a Teams meeting.  
2. Click **Share** in meeting controls.  
3. Under **PowerPoint Live**, select:
   - A recently used file, **or**  
   - **Browse** to open from OneDrive or your computer. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
   - Or select **Present in Teams** if your file is open in PowerPoint. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

## Presenter View Controls  
- Use navigation arrows or the thumbnail strip to move between slides.  
- Open **Grid view** to jump directly to any slide. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Flip between views (e.g., Camera + Slides: “Standout,” “Cameo” layouts). :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Use tools like **Laser Pointer**, **Pen**, **Highlighter**, and **Eraser**. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

## Audience Experience  
- Viewers can independently navigate slides; they can return to the presenter's position using **Sync to Presenter**. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- They can interact with links and embedded media at their own pace. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Accessibility options like slide translation and high‑contrast mode are supported. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  

## Best Practices  
- Use **PowerPoint Live** over traditional screen sharing for cleaner presentations. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- Enable audience navigation to let attendees review content at their own pace, but turn it off via **Private view** if it may distract. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
- Presenters without a second display can still access notes and controls within a single-screen layout. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  

## Notes & Limitations  
- **PowerPoint Live** not supported in Teams live events, CVI, or VTC endpoints. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- On the web client, use Microsoft Edge 18+/Chrome 65+ to view Presenter view. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
- Recording will not include animations, whiteboard content, or embedded media visuals. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  
- When uploading a non-Team file during a channel meeting, it's saved to the Files tab. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}
