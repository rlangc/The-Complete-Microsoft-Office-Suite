## Notes & Best Practices  
- External users cannot access or edit meeting notes.  
- For recurring meetings, edit the meeting series to maintain a single shared notes document.  
- Mobile users should schedule meeting notes via desktop or web before the meeting.  
- Collaborative notes sync in real time, ensuring all changes are visible to attendees.
