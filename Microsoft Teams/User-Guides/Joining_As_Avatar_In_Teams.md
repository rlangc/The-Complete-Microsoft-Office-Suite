# Joining as an Avatar in Microsoft Teams

## Overview
Microsoft Teams allows users to join meetings using a 3D avatar, enabling a more expressive and engaging presence without using a live camera. This feature is part of Microsoft Mesh and helps users represent themselves visually while maintaining privacy and comfort.

## Prerequisites
- Microsoft Teams desktop app (latest version)
- Microsoft 365 account with an active license that includes Mesh avatars
- Enabled by your Teams administrator

## How to Set Up and Use an Avatar

### Step 1: Enable Avatars in Settings
1. Open Microsoft Teams.
2. Click on your profile picture and choose **Settings**.
3. Navigate to **Avatars (Preview)** or **Mesh Avatars**, if available.
4. Enable the avatar feature if not already active.

### Step 2: Create Your Avatar
1. In the Teams left-hand sidebar, click the **Avatars** app (you may need to search for it or install it from the App Store).
2. Click **Create Avatar**.
3. Customize your avatar by adjusting:
   - Facial features
   - Hair, eyes, and skin tone
   - Outfit and accessories
4. Save your avatar when finished.

### Step 3: Join a Meeting as Your Avatar
1. When joining a meeting, in the **Join Now** window, click **Effects and Avatars**.
2. Select the **Avatars** tab.
3. Choose the avatar you created.
4. Click **Join Now**.

Your avatar will represent you in the meeting with lip sync, head movement, and gestures based on your microphone and reactions.

## Avatar Features in a Meeting
- Avatars mirror facial expressions and voice-based gestures.
- Use **Reactions** and **Hand Raise** to make your avatar respond visually.

## Notes for Admins
- To enable avatars for your organization:
  - Go to the Microsoft Teams Admin Center.
  - Under **Teams Apps > Manage Apps**, search for **Mesh Avatars**.
  - Set the app status to **Allowed** for selected users or all users.
