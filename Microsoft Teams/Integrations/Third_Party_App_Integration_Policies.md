# Third-Party App Integration Policies in Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams allows integration with a wide range of third-party applications. This guide explains how to manage, approve, and govern these integrations through app permission policies, security controls, and organizational policies.

## Overview

Admins can:

- Enable or restrict specific third-party apps across the organization
- Define user group permissions for app access
- Monitor app usage and audit integrations for compliance

## App Permission Policies

App permission policies control which apps users can access within Teams.

### Steps to Configure

1. Go to **Microsoft Teams Admin Center**
2. Navigate to **Teams apps > Permission policies**
3. Create or modify a policy
4. Set permissions:
   - Allow all apps
   - Block all apps
   - Allow/block specific apps
5. Assign the policy to users or groups

### Use Cases

| Scenario                         | Configuration Strategy                              |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Allow HR to use SurveyMonkey     | Create a policy allowing SurveyMonkey for HR group  |
| Block social apps org-wide       | Block apps like Facebook or Twitter at the tenant level |
| Allow dev tools for IT           | Permit GitHub, Jira, etc., for IT personnel         |

## App Setup Policies

These define which apps are pinned by default and the order they appear in the Teams interface.

- Go to **Teams apps > Setup policies**
- Pin frequently used apps (e.g., Planner, Power BI, SharePoint)
- Tailor setup policies per department or role

## App Management Best Practices

- Use app catalog reviews to vet third-party integrations
- Require apps to meet data handling and compliance requirements
- Document approval workflows for new app requests
- Regularly audit app usage reports in Admin Center

## Security and Compliance

- Check app certification in the Microsoft AppSource directory
- Use Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) to monitor data flow
- Enable conditional access policies for high-risk apps
- Apply DLP policies to manage sensitive information within apps

## Monitoring and Reporting

- Admin Center > Teams apps > Manage apps > Usage reports
- View install metrics, access patterns, and usage frequency
- Use audit logs to track who enabled or disabled apps
