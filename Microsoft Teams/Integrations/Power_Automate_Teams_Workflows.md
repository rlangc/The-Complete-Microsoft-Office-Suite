# Power Automate + Microsoft Teams Integration Guide

Power Automate allows you to build automated workflows that integrate seamlessly with Microsoft Teams. These flows can streamline communication, approvals, alerts, and task management within your Teams environment.

## Overview

Power Automate enables users to:

- Trigger actions in Teams based on events in Microsoft 365 or third-party services.
- Automate routine communications like welcome messages, reminders, or approvals.
- Create flows that post to Teams when a record changes in SharePoint, Dataverse, Excel, or even external apps.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Automated Notifications

**Example:** Send a Teams message when a SharePoint item is created.

- **Trigger:** “When an item is created” (SharePoint)
- **Action:** “Post a message in a chat or channel” (Teams)

### 2. Approval Workflows

**Example:** Request manager approval and notify stakeholders in Teams.

- **Trigger:** “When a new response is submitted” (Microsoft Forms)
- **Action 1:** “Start and wait for an approval”
- **Action 2:** “Post an approval outcome in a Teams channel”

### 3. Scheduled Reminders

**Example:** Daily task reminders to a project team.

- **Trigger:** “Recurrence” (every weekday at 8 AM)
- **Action:** “Post a message in a Teams channel”

### 4. Alerting on External Events

**Example:** Notify a channel when an RSS feed publishes a new post or a GitHub repo receives a new issue.

- **Trigger:** “When a feed item is published” (RSS) or “When a new issue is created” (GitHub)
- **Action:** “Post message in Teams”

## Tips and Best Practices

- Use dynamic content and variables to personalize messages.
- Limit flows that post messages to reduce notification fatigue.
- Use environment variables and connection references for enterprise deployments.
- Monitor run history and enable notifications for flow failures.
- Document flows for support and auditing.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure users creating flows have the proper permissions in Teams and connected services.
- Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies to restrict connectors across environments.
- Regularly audit shared and team-owned flows to ensure compliance.
