# Microsoft Planner and Tasks Integration in Teams

Microsoft Teams integrates with Microsoft Planner and To Do through the **Tasks by Planner and To Do** app, enabling unified task management across projects and personal workflows. This guide outlines how to use Planner in Teams to create, assign, and track tasks collaboratively.

## Overview

Planner in Teams provides:

- Visual Kanban boards for project task tracking
- Integrated views of personal tasks from Microsoft To Do
- Assignment, due date, and checklist management within Teams channels

## How to Add Planner to a Channel

1. Go to a Teams channel and click **+ Add a tab**
2. Choose **Tasks by Planner and To Do**
3. Select an existing plan or create a new one
4. Name the tab and click **Save**

Team members can now view and manage shared tasks from within the Teams interface.

## Creating and Managing Tasks

- **Create a task**: Add a title, due date, description, and assign it to a team member.
- **Bucket organization**: Group tasks under customizable categories (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Completed").
- **Checklists**: Break down tasks into substeps.
- **Attachments**: Add files or links relevant to each task.

## Viewing Personal and Shared Tasks

- Access the **Tasks** app in the left Teams navigation bar.
- View:
  - **Assigned to Me** (personal tasks from To Do)
  - **Shared Plans** (Planner boards from Teams channels)

## Notifications and Reminders

- Assigned users receive notifications in Teams and Outlook.
- Due date reminders can be configured through To Do or Outlook.
- Notifications also appear in the Teams Activity feed.
