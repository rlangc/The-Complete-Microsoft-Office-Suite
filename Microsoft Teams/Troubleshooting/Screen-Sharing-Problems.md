# Troubleshooting Screen Sharing Problems in Microsoft Teams

Screen sharing is a core feature in Teams, but it can fail due to browser restrictions, outdated software, policy settings, or conflicting applications. This guide outlines how to resolve common issues.

## Common Screen Sharing Issues

- "Screen sharing failed" message
- Grey or blank screen shared
- Participants canâ€™t see the shared window
- Screen share button is grayed out
- Screen share ends unexpectedly

## User-Level Troubleshooting

### 1. Confirm Teams Version

- Ensure you're using the latest version of the desktop app
- Web users should use **Microsoft Edge** or **Google Chrome** for full compatibility

### 2. Permissions Check

#### Windows:
- Check Teams has permission to record the screen (some policies block screen capture)

#### macOS:
- Go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Screen Recording**
- Ensure **Microsoft Teams** is checked

### 3. Restart & Close Conflicting Apps

- Quit Teams and relaunch
- Close other conferencing apps (Zoom, Skype, etc.)

## Browser-Specific Tips

| Browser | Troubleshooting |
|---------|-----------------|
| Chrome | Ensure screen share permissions are enabled |
| Firefox | Limited support; avoid using for sharing |
| Edge | Fully supported, including tab/window sharing |
| Safari | Not supported for screen sharing |

- Clear browser cache and try again
- Use Incognito Mode to test for extension conflicts

## Admin-Level Settings

- Check **Meeting Policies** in Teams Admin Center:
  - Ensure **Screen sharing mode** is set to **Entire screen or single application**
  - Verify **Allow IP video** and **Content sharing** settings

- Review Conditional Access or Endpoint Protection tools that may block screen capture

## Advanced Fixes

- Use a wired connection for stability
- Switch to "Window" sharing if full screen fails
- If on VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure), ensure screen sharing is supported in that environment
