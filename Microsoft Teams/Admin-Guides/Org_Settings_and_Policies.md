# Organization Settings and Policies in Microsoft Teams

This guide covers core organization-wide settings and policy types in Microsoft Teams. These configurations define how Teams operates across your entire organization, impacting collaboration, security, and governance.

## Core Org-Wide Settings

These settings apply universally and affect all users in your Microsoft 365 tenant. They are managed via the Microsoft Teams Admin Center or Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

### External Access

- **Purpose**: Allows or restricts users from communicating with people in external Microsoft 365 organizations.
- **Options**:
  - Allow all external domains (default)
  - Allow only specific domains
  - Block specific domains
  - Block all external access
- **Use Cases**:
  - Enable B2B collaboration with partners or vendors.
  - Restrict access for regulatory or compliance reasons.

### Guest Access

- **Purpose**: Controls whether individuals outside your organization (guests) can be added to Teams.
- **Features Controlled**:
  - Messaging and calling
  - Meeting participation
  - File sharing
- **Recommendation**: Enable only if your organization requires collaboration with non-employees. Ensure guest policies are reviewed regularly.

### Org-Wide Teams

- **Purpose**: Automatically adds all users in your tenant to a single, universal team.
- **Considerations**:
  - Useful for all-hands announcements, policy updates, or culture-building.
  - Limited to tenants with fewer than 10,000 users.
- **Best Practice**: Restrict posting permissions to owners or designated communicators to reduce noise.

## Policy Types in Microsoft Teams

Teams uses policies to control what features users can access and how they can use them. Policies can be applied globally or assigned to specific users or groups.

### Messaging Policies

- **Features Controlled**:
  - Use of GIFs, memes, and stickers
  - Chat editing and deletion

### Meeting Policies

- **Purpose**: Control options available before, during, and after meetings.
- **Features Controlled**:
  - Cloud recording
  - Transcription and captions
  - Lobby behavior
  - Allowing anonymous join
  - Participant video and content sharing

### App Permission Policies

- **Purpose**: Govern access to Microsoft and third-party apps.
- **Features Controlled**:
  - Block all apps, allow specific apps, or allow all except blocked
  - Enable/disable custom apps
  - Define safe boundaries for user productivity

### Teams Update Policies

- **Purpose**: Control how Teams client updates and new features are rolled out.
- **Features Controlled**:
  - Access to public preview features
  - Experience with new features before full rollout
- **Use Case**: Allow IT staff to access preview mode for testing before enabling features org-wide.

## Summary Table

| Policy Type             | Key Control Areas                                      |

## Best Practices

- Assign policies based on user roles (e.g., executives, educators, contractors).
- Review policies quarterly to ensure they reflect current security and collaboration needs.
- Document and communicate policy updates to end users to reduce confusion.
- Use PowerShell for batch assignment of policies to large user groups.
