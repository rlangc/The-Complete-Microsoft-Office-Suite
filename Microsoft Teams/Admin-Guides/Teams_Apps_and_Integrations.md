# Managing Teams Apps and Integrations

This guide provides administrators with best practices and configuration options for managing third-party and custom applications in Microsoft Teams. Apps and integrations allow users to extend the functionality of Teams, but they must be managed carefully to ensure security, compliance, and productivity.

## App Management

Administrators can control the availability and permissions of apps across the organization by using the Microsoft Teams Admin Center or PowerShell.

### Pre-Approve Apps

- Curate a list of pre-approved apps that users can install without admin intervention.
- Restrict users from installing unverified or unnecessary third-party apps.
- Review app ratings, publisher information, and compliance details before approval.

**How to Pre-Approve Apps**:
1. Go to the Teams Admin Center > Teams apps > Manage apps
2. Use the status toggle to allow or block apps
3. Mark trusted apps as “pre-approved” for end users

### App Permission Policies

- Define which apps are available for different user groups.
- Create multiple policies for roles such as staff, students, contractors, or executives.
- Choose from:
  - Allow all apps
  - Block all apps except those allowed
  - Allow specific apps only

**Configuration**:
- Teams Admin Center > Teams apps > Permission policies
- Assign policies per user or group via the Microsoft 365 Admin Center or PowerShell

### Custom Apps

- Deploy line-of-business (LOB) applications specific to your organization.
- Upload custom apps (e.g., internal HR bots, approval workflows) into Teams using the Admin Center.
- Control who can upload and use custom apps with app setup policies.

**Deployment Options**:
- Upload via Teams Admin Center > Teams apps > Manage apps > Upload
- Use App Studio to develop and test apps
- Publish apps to specific teams or users only

## Integration Scenarios

Microsoft Teams supports seamless integration with various Microsoft 365 tools and services. These integrations enhance collaboration by embedding commonly used resources directly into team workflows.

| Tool         | Use Case                                  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Power BI     | Embed dashboards in Teams tabs to share reports and analytics |
| SharePoint   | Link document libraries to Teams for direct access to shared files |
| Forms/Lists  | Create and run internal surveys, forms, and data collection sheets directly in channels |

## Security and Compliance Considerations

- Review the security and compliance status of all third-party apps using Microsoft’s App Certification program.
- Regularly audit which apps are being used and by whom.
- Disable user upload of custom apps if not governed by IT.
- Monitor app usage through Teams Admin Center > Analytics & reports > Usage reports.

## Best Practices

- Start with a limited app list and expand based on validated business needs.
- Segment app permissions by user roles to reduce risk.
- Educate users on how to request new apps through an internal approval workflow.
- Require justification or business value assessment before enabling new third-party apps.
- Review app data-sharing practices and ensure they align with your organization’s compliance standards.
