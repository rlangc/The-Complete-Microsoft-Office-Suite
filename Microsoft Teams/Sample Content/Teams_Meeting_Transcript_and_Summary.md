# Transcript – Project Check-In: Internal LMS Update

**Date:** _(Sample Meeting)_  
**Duration:** ~5 minutes  
**Participants:**  
- **Alex (Project Manager)**  
- **Jordan (Instructional Designer)**  
- **Riley (Software Engineer)**  
- **Taylor (QA Lead)**

**Alex:** All right, let’s get started. Quick check-in on the internal LMS update. Where do we stand on the prototype?

**Riley:** As of this morning, the new dashboard layout is live in the dev environment. I’ve pushed it for review.

**Jordan:** Great. I actually had a chance to run through it—some parts look sharp, but I do have questions about the new tagging feature.

**Alex:** Let’s park that for a second. Riley, were the accessibility checks built into that new layout?

**Riley:** Not fully. We’ve added ARIA labels for the buttons, but the keyboard navigation isn’t quite there yet.

**Taylor:** We flagged that too during exploratory testing. I can prioritize a keyboard nav pass today if needed.

**Alex:** That’d be ideal, thanks. Jordan—what were your questions on tagging?

**Jordan:** Mainly, how are tags being stored? Are they mapped to content metadata or user interaction?

**Riley:** Right now, they’re stored in the content object itself—metadata only. We haven’t connected it to user behavior yet.

**Jordan:** Got it. So no tracking on user tagging activity?

**Riley:** Correct, not yet.

**Taylor:** Would that affect any of our SCORM tracking?

**Jordan:** Not directly, but it would be useful to eventually connect tags to module feedback. Could help surface learning gaps.

**Alex:** Let’s mark that as a future enhancement. For now, keep it metadata-only.

**Taylor:** Do you want a formal test script for tagging?

**Alex:** Yes, and please include edge cases—especially with duplicate or empty tags.

**Taylor:** Noted. I’ll have it ready by EOD tomorrow.

**Alex:** Perfect. Last item: Riley, can you update the roadmap doc to reflect the revised timeline?

**Riley:** Sure, I’ll revise that after standup and push to SharePoint.

**Alex:** Thanks, all. Let’s regroup same time Friday. Ping me if anything blocks you.
