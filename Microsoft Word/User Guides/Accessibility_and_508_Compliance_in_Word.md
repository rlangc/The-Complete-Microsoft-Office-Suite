# Accessibility and 508 Compliance in Word

Ensuring your documents are accessible to all users—including individuals with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities—is a critical part of professional document creation. Microsoft Word includes built-in accessibility tools that help authors meet Section 508 compliance and create inclusive content.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessible documents support universal usability and ensure compliance with legal and organizational standards such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Making documents accessible improves readability, navigation, and compatibility with assistive technologies like screen readers.

## Using the Accessibility Checker

Microsoft Word includes an **Accessibility Checker** that reviews your document and suggests improvements.

- Go to **Review > Check Accessibility**.
- A pane appears showing issues such as missing alt text, improper heading order, or unclear hyperlinks.
- Click each issue to jump directly to the problem area and view recommended actions.

Tip: Run the checker regularly throughout the document creation process—not just at the end.

## Applying Alt Text and Proper Headings

### Alternative Text (Alt Text)
- Alt text provides descriptions of images for screen reader users.
- To add it:
  - Right-click on an image > **View Alt Text**.
  - Write a brief, meaningful description of the image’s content or purpose.

### Proper Use of Headings
- Use **built-in heading styles** (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) to provide logical structure.
- This helps screen readers navigate the document efficiently.
- Avoid manually styling headings with bold/size—use the **Styles** pane instead.

## Avoiding Color-Only Indicators and Merged Tables

### Color Contrast and Indicators
- Ensure sufficient **color contrast** between text and background (use online tools to test).
- Do **not rely on color alone** to convey meaning (e.g., "items in red are required").

### Tables and Layouts
- Avoid **merged cells**, which can confuse screen readers.
- Use tables for **data only**, not for layout or formatting.
- Always include a **header row** and define it as such under **Table Tools > Layout > Repeat Header Row**.

## Additional Accessibility Tips

- Use meaningful link text (e.g., “View report” instead of “Click here”).
- Avoid using text boxes or floating objects where possible.
- Keep document language set correctly under **Review > Language**.

By following these guidelines and using Word’s built-in tools, you can ensure your documents are usable by a wider audience and compliant with modern accessibility standards.
