# Tracking Changes and Using Comments in Microsoft Word

Microsoft Word’s built-in review tools make it easy to collaborate on documents while maintaining control over edits and feedback. Whether you're reviewing a colleague’s work or submitting edits for approval, **Track Changes** and **Comments** allow for transparent and efficient collaboration.

This guide walks you through how to enable Track Changes, insert and manage comments, and review edits using Word’s powerful revision features.

## 1. Enabling Track Changes

**Track Changes** highlights every insertion, deletion, and formatting change made in the document.

### How to Enable:
1. Go to the **Review** tab
2. Click **Track Changes** to toggle it on
3. All subsequent edits will be marked in red (or a designated color) with strikethroughs and underlines

> You can also use **Ctrl + Shift + E** as a shortcut to enable/disable Track Changes.

### Display Options:
- Use the **Display for Review** dropdown to choose how changes appear:
  - **Simple Markup**: Clean view with change indicators in the margin
  - **All Markup**: Full detail of every tracked change
  - **No Markup**: Preview of the final version
  - **Original**: View the document before any edits

## 2. Inserting and Managing Comments

**Comments** provide space to offer suggestions, ask questions, or flag issues without modifying the text directly.

### Inserting Comments:
1. Highlight the relevant text or place your cursor
2. Click **Review > New Comment**
3. Type your note and press **Esc** or click outside to finish

### Replying and Resolving:
- Click **Reply** under an existing comment to join the discussion
- Once addressed, click **Resolve** to mark it complete (comment remains grayed out for reference)

### Tips:
- Use **@mentions** (e.g., `@Jane`) to tag collaborators and notify them via email (Microsoft 365 feature)
- Navigate comments via **Previous/Next** buttons in the **Review** tab

## 3. Reviewing and Accepting/Rejecting Changes

As documents circulate for review, Word lets you accept or reject each suggested change.

### Reviewing Edits:
- Use the **Next** and **Previous** buttons in the **Review** tab to jump between changes
- Click **Accept** or **Reject** for each change individually

### Bulk Actions:
- Use **Accept All Changes** or **Reject All Changes** for faster approval when appropriate
- Combine this with a final review pass using **No Markup** view to verify clean output

## Best Practices

- Turn on **Track Changes** before editing shared documents
- Leave comments instead of rewriting large sections—this helps maintain clarity
- Use **Simple Markup** for client-facing documents, and **All Markup** when editing internally
- Always **review comments and accept/reject changes** before finalizing or exporting a document

## Summary

Word’s Track Changes and Comments tools streamline collaborative editing by clearly distinguishing suggestions, edits, and feedback. These features support transparency and accountability while enabling contributors to review and respond effectively. By mastering these tools, you can manage version control, simplify document review cycles, and produce cleaner, more collaborative content.
