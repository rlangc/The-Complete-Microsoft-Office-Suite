# Presenter View and Slideshow Tools in Microsoft PowerPoint

Presenter View and slideshow tools in PowerPoint help presenters deliver smooth, professional presentations while staying organized and in control. These tools allow you to see your speaker notes, preview upcoming slides, annotate content in real time, and navigate seamlessly—all while the audience sees only the full-screen slideshow.

This guide walks you through setting up and using Presenter View, navigation options during a live presentation, and the annotation tools that enhance interactivity.

## 1. What Is Presenter View?

**Presenter View** is a special display mode that shows different content on the presenter’s screen and the audience’s screen.

### Presenter View Features:
- **Current Slide** – shows what the audience sees
- **Next Slide Preview** – helps you prepare for transitions
- **Speaker Notes** – private notes visible only to you
- **Timer and Clock** – track time during the presentation
- **Navigation Tools** – jump between slides easily

> Ideal for rehearsed presentations, lectures, and complex slide decks.

## 2. Enabling Presenter View

### On a Dual Monitor Setup:
1. Go to **Slide Show > Use Presenter View**
2. Connect a second screen or projector
3. PowerPoint will automatically assign:
   - **Slideshow** to the audience screen
   - **Presenter View** to your screen

### Manual Setup:
- Under **Slide Show > Monitor**, select which monitor shows Presenter View
- You can also preview Presenter View by starting **Slide Show > From Beginning** with one screen and choosing **Swap Displays**

## 3. Using Presenter View

### Presenter View Controls:
- **Advance Slides**: Click arrows or use keyboard arrows
- **Jump to Slide**: Click the grid icon (bottom-left) to view all slides

### Customizing Presenter View:

## 4. Annotating Slides During a Presentation

### Accessing Annotation Tools:

2. Click the **Pen icon** for tools:
   - **Laser Pointer**
   - **Pen** (draw freehand)
   - **Highlighter**
   - **Eraser**

### Tips:
- Use annotations to underline key points or guide attention
- Annotations can be saved when prompted after the presentation ends

> Annotations only appear on the presentation screen, not in Presenter View.
