# Accessibility in Microsoft PowerPoint

Ensuring that PowerPoint presentations are accessible means making them usable by people of all abilities, including individuals with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities. Microsoft PowerPoint includes a variety of built-in accessibility tools and best practices to help users design inclusive slide content.

This guide walks you through how to make your PowerPoint slides accessible by using appropriate tools, formatting structures, and inclusive design strategies.

## 1. Using the Accessibility Checker

The **Accessibility Checker** helps identify and fix potential barriers for people with disabilities.

### How to Access:
- Go to **Review > Check Accessibility**
- A panel opens showing inspection results with suggestions

### What It Checks:
- Missing alt text
- Reading order issues
- Insufficient color contrast
- Use of blank slide titles

> Use the “Additional Information” links for guidance on fixing each issue.

## 2. Adding Alt Text to Visual Elements

**Alternative text (alt text)** describes images and other visual content for users relying on screen readers.

### Add Alt Text To:
- Pictures
- Icons
- Shapes
- SmartArt
- Charts
- Tables

### How to Add:
1. Right-click the object
2. Select **Edit Alt Text**
3. Enter a concise, meaningful description

> Avoid phrases like “image of” or “graphic of”—just describe the content.

## 3. Structuring Slides with Proper Reading Order

Screen readers interpret slides based on the **z-order** (layering) of objects. The correct **reading order** ensures that slide elements are presented logically.

### To Check and Adjust:
1. Go to **Home > Arrange > Selection Pane**
2. Review the list (bottom is read first, top is last)
3. Reorder items using the up/down arrows

> Title should be read first, followed by content, then visuals.

## 4. Slide Titles and Navigation

Each slide should have a unique and descriptive title to aid navigation for screen reader users.

### Best Practices:
- Use the **Title Placeholder**, not a manually inserted text box
- Avoid leaving titles blank
- Ensure consistency across slides

> PowerPoint automatically recognizes proper title elements for accessibility.

## 5. Ensuring Color Contrast

Text should stand out clearly against its background to support users with low vision or color blindness.

### Guidelines:
- Use high-contrast color combinations (e.g., dark text on a light background)
- Avoid red/green pairings
- Use the **Accessibility Checker** or online contrast tools like WebAIM

> Stick to standard PowerPoint themes when possible—they're generally contrast-compliant.

## 6. Avoiding Color-Only Indicators

Don’t rely on color alone to convey meaning (e.g., "red text = error").

### Use:
- Labels
- Icons
- Patterns
- Text annotations

> Supplement visuals with explanatory text when using color-coded charts or legends.

## 7. Closed Captions and Subtitles for Audio/Video

When including multimedia:
- Add captions to videos
- Provide transcripts for narration
- Enable **Live Subtitles** when presenting

### For Recorded Slideshows:
Use **Insert > Video > Video on My PC** and choose caption files when needed.

> Microsoft Stream or other video platforms can be used to generate closed captions externally.

## 8. Keyboard Navigation and Focus Order

Ensure that your slides can be navigated using only a keyboard (important for users with motor impairments).

### Tips:
- Keep navigation consistent
- Avoid excessive animation
- Use slide layouts and placeholders instead of freeform text boxes

> Test navigation using the **Tab** key to move through objects.

## 9. Using Templates and Slide Layouts

Using built-in **slide layouts** (rather than custom ones) helps maintain accessibility structure.

### Benefits:
- Consistent use of titles and content placeholders
- Preserves reading order and formatting
- Easier for screen readers to interpret

> Avoid inserting random text boxes; use layout placeholders for content.

## Summary

Creating accessible PowerPoint presentations is not only a best practice—it’s a professional standard that ensures all audience members can engage with your content. By using the Accessibility Checker, adding descriptive alt text, following structured slide layouts, and maintaining strong visual contrast, you promote inclusion and improve communication for everyone.
