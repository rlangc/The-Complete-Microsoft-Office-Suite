# Exporting, Converting, and Publishing in Microsoft PowerPoint

PowerPoint presentations aren’t limited to the `.pptx` format. Whether you're sharing a slide deck online, embedding it in a learning platform, distributing a printable version, or creating a self-running video, PowerPoint includes robust export and publishing tools.

This guide covers how to convert presentations into video, PDF, and image formats, how to package self-contained slide shows, and how to prepare your content for embedding or uploading to other platforms.

## 1. Exporting to PDF

PDF is ideal for printing or sharing read-only versions of your slides.

### How to Export:
1. Go to **File > Export**
2. Click **Create PDF/XPS Document**
3. Choose file location and options (e.g., slides only, handouts)
4. Click **Publish**

### Options:
- Export all slides or specific ranges
- Include speaker notes or multiple slides per page
- Optimize for printing or online viewing

> PDFs maintain layout fidelity and are widely accessible.

## 2. Exporting to Video

Turn your presentation into a narrated or timed video for asynchronous delivery.

### Steps:
1. Go to **File > Export > Create a Video**
2. Choose resolution (Ultra HD, Full HD, HD)
3. Set slide timings and narrations:
   - Use recorded timings if available
   - Or set a uniform duration per slide
4. Click **Create Video** and choose a destination

### Format:
- Videos are saved as `.mp4` files by default

> Useful for eLearning, webinars, or social media publishing.

## 3. Saving as PowerPoint Show (.ppsx)

Create a self-running version of your presentation that opens in full-screen slideshow mode.

### Steps:
1. Go to **File > Save As**
2. Choose file type: **PowerPoint Show (*.ppsx)**
3. Save and share

> Ideal for kiosk-style displays, portfolio demos, or event signage.

## 4. Exporting as Images

Save slides as image files to use in other platforms or tools.

### Steps:
1. Go to **File > Save As**
2. Select image type: **JPEG** or **PNG**
3. Choose to export all slides or just one

### Uses:
- Uploading individual slides to websites or LMS platforms
- Adding to documents, email signatures, or social media

> PNG is best for higher-quality images with transparency.

## 5. Embedding PowerPoint in Other Platforms

You can embed presentations in websites, LMS platforms, or SharePoint using embed code or links.

### Options:
- Upload your `.pptx` or `.pdf` to OneDrive or SharePoint
- Click **File > Share > Embed**
- Copy the HTML embed code
- Paste into your website, blog, or intranet platform

> Some platforms (like Microsoft Sway or Canvas LMS) allow direct PowerPoint integration.

## 6. Converting to Google Slides

You can convert PowerPoint files to work in Google Slides for cloud-based editing and collaboration.

### Steps:
1. Upload your `.pptx` file to Google Drive
2. Right-click > **Open With > Google Slides**
3. Edit and save as native Google Slides or export again as `.pptx` or `.pdf`

> Note: Some animations, fonts, or advanced features may not fully convert.

## 7. Best Practices for Publishing

- Test playback and formatting before sharing
- Include transcripts or captions for accessibility in videos
- Avoid embedding large media files when sharing online—compress first
- Provide both editable and read-only formats when needed (e.g., `.pptx` and `.pdf`)

## Summary

Microsoft PowerPoint makes it easy to repurpose and publish presentations in multiple formats to suit different audiences and delivery modes. Whether you need a video, PDF, slideshow, or web-embedded version, exporting and publishing tools ensure your content is accessible, professional, and adaptable across platforms.
