# Adding and Formatting Text and Slides in Microsoft PowerPoint

Effective presentations begin with well-structured slides and clearly formatted text. PowerPoint offers flexible tools for working with slide layouts, adding and formatting text, and organizing your presentation with tools like Outline View and slide notes.

This guide walks through the process of adding new slides, working with various layouts, formatting text for readability and emphasis, and managing your slide content efficiently.

## 1. Inserting New Slides

### How to Add a Slide:
1. Navigate to the **Home** tab
2. Click **New Slide**
3. Choose a layout from the dropdown (e.g., Title and Content, Two Content, Blank)

> Use **Ctrl + M** to quickly insert a new slide with the default layout.

## 2. Understanding Slide Layouts

PowerPoint layouts provide predefined text boxes and object placements.

### Common Layouts:
- **Title Slide**: For your presentation's opening
- **Title and Content**: Standard for most slides
- **Section Header**: To divide parts of your presentation
- **Comparison**: Two content columns side by side
- **Blank**: No placeholdersâ€”great for custom designs

### How to Change a Layout:
- Right-click on the slide > **Layout** > Select a new one

> Using layouts ensures consistent formatting and better accessibility.

## 3. Adding and Formatting Text

### Adding Text:
- Click into a **placeholder box**
- Start typing directly
- Or insert a new **Text Box** via **Insert > Text Box**

### Formatting Tools:
- Use the **Home** tab for font, size, color, bold/italic/underline
- Apply bullet points or numbered lists
- Use **Align**, **Line Spacing**, and **Text Direction** to improve readability

> Stick to 24pt+ fonts for body text and 32pt+ for titles in presentations.

## 4. Using the Outline View for Organization

The **Outline View** allows you to view and edit all slide titles and main bullet points in one panel.

### How to Use:
1. Go to **View > Outline View**
2. Edit text directly from the panel
3. Drag and drop to reorder slides or promote/demote bullets

> This is a fast way to review structure and ensure your presentation has a logical flow.

## 5. Adding Speaker Notes

Speaker notes help presenters remember key points without crowding slides with text.

### To Add Notes:
- Select a slide
- Locate the **Notes** pane beneath the slide canvas
- Click and type your notes

> Use **View > Notes Page** to see formatted versions of your notes or print them.

## 6. Slide Titles and Accessibility

Always include a title on each slide for consistency and accessibility.

### Tips:
- Use the title placeholder, not a text box
- Keep titles short and descriptive
- Avoid repeating titles unless intentional (e.g., in a series)

## Summary

Organizing and formatting content in PowerPoint starts with understanding layouts, adding meaningful text, and using structural tools like Outline View and notes. Keeping slides concise, readable, and well-structured supports both the presenter and the audience, resulting in a more effective presentation experience.
