# Interactive Slides and Hyperlinking in Microsoft PowerPoint

Interactive presentations go beyond linear slideshows by allowing viewers to navigate freely, trigger actions, and engage with content dynamically. Using hyperlinks, action buttons, and triggers, you can create custom menus, interactive quizzes, and branching paths that respond to user input.

This guide outlines how to design non-linear presentations and incorporate interactivity to enhance user engagement and functionality.

## 1. Understanding Interactive Slides

Interactive slides allow users to:
- Click buttons or text to jump to specific slides
- Navigate via menus or dashboards
- Take self-paced quizzes
- Simulate software, scenarios, or decision trees

> Ideal for kiosks, eLearning, product demos, and self-guided experiences.

## 2. Inserting Hyperlinks

### How to Add a Hyperlink:
1. Select text, image, shape, or icon
2. Right-click and choose **Link** or go to **Insert > Link**
3. Choose one of the following:
   - **Place in This Document** (link to another slide)
   - **Existing File or Web Page**
   - **Email Address**
   - **Create New Document**

### Tips:
- Use descriptive link text (e.g., “Go to Quiz” instead of “Click Here”)
- Format linked objects for visual clarity (color, underline, icons)

## 3. Using Action Buttons

Action buttons are pre-designed shapes used for navigation or launching actions.

### To Insert an Action Button:
1. Go to **Insert > Shapes > Action Buttons** (at the bottom of the list)
2. Select a button (e.g., Home, Next, Back, Help)
3. Draw it on the slide
4. In the **Action Settings** dialog, choose:
   - **Hyperlink to:** (e.g., next slide, specific slide, URL)
   - Or run a **program**, **sound**, or **macro**

> Use **Slide Master** to place navigation buttons on all slides consistently.

## 4. Building Interactive Menus and Navigation

You can design a “home” or “menu” slide with clickable buttons that branch to different parts of your presentation.

### Example:
- Title Slide with buttons:
   - 📂 Company Overview → Slide 2
   - 💼 Services → Slide 5
   - 📞 Contact → Slide 10

Each button is a shape or icon with a hyperlink to the corresponding slide.

### Design Tip:
Use consistent design elements (colors, fonts, icons) to unify the interactive experience.

## 5. Creating Non-Linear Navigation

### Techniques:
- Use hyperlinks to skip, jump back, or branch between sections
- Create “Back to Menu” or “Next Section” buttons
- Hide slides from linear playback via **Slide Show > Hide Slide**
- Use **Zoom** (Insert > Zoom) to create dynamic interactive overviews

> Zoom links allow animated transitions between slide sections, similar to Prezi.

## 6. Interactive Quizzes and Feedback

### Create a Quiz:
- Use a question slide with multiple answer shapes (buttons)
- Hyperlink each answer to:
   - A **Correct Answer** slide
   - An **Incorrect Answer** slide (with retry or explanation)
- Add **“Try Again”** links to loop back to the question

> Use animation triggers or VBA for more advanced branching or scoring logic.

## 7. Accessibility and Usability Considerations

- Use **Alt Text** for linked images and buttons
- Provide keyboard navigation options
- Keep interactive elements large enough for click accuracy
- Test all links and navigation paths

## Summary

Hyperlinking and interactive features in PowerPoint transform passive slide decks into dynamic, user-driven experiences. Whether you're building a training module, navigation menu, or branching quiz, these tools enable creative storytelling and flexible learning paths. Incorporate them to make your presentations more engaging, responsive, and effective.
