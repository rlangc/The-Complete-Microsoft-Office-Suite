# Data Validation and Drop-Down Lists in Microsoft Excel

This guide explains how to use data validation to restrict input and create drop-down lists for cleaner, more consistent data entry.

## What Is Data Validation?

Data validation limits what a user can enter into a cell. This is helpful for ensuring accuracy and enforcing rules (e.g., date ranges, number limits, predefined values).

## Creating a Drop-Down List

1. Select the cell or range.
2. Go to the Data tab > Data Validation.
3. Under "Allow", choose "List".
4. Enter a comma-separated list (e.g., Yes,No,Maybe) or refer to a range.
5. Click OK.

## Restricting Input

You can also set:
- Whole numbers only
- Decimal values
- Date or time ranges
- Text length

## Custom Input Messages and Error Alerts

- Input Message: Displays guidance when the cell is selected.
- Error Alert: Displays a warning or stop message when invalid data is entered.

Using data validation improves data quality and reduces errors during input.
