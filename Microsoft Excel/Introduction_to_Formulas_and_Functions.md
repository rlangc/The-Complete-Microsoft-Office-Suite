# Introduction to Formulas and Functions in Microsoft Excel

This guide covers the basics of writing formulas and using functions to perform calculations and automate data processing in Excel.

## What Is a Formula?

A formula is an expression that calculates a value. All formulas in Excel begin with an equals sign (`=`).

Example:
```
=A1 + B1
```

---

## Common Arithmetic Operations

- Addition: `=A1 + A2`
- Subtraction: `=A1 - A2`
- Multiplication: `=A1 * A2`
- Division: `=A1 / A2`

---

## Using Functions

Functions are predefined formulas that perform specific calculations.

Common examples:
- `=SUM(A1:A5)` - Adds all values from A1 through A5.
- `=AVERAGE(A1:A5)` - Calculates the mean.
- `=MIN(A1:A5)` - Finds the smallest value.
- `=MAX(A1:A5)` - Finds the largest value.

## Relative vs. Absolute References

- **Relative**: Adjusts when copied (`=A1 + B1`)
- **Absolute**: Fixed reference (`=$A$1 + $B$1`)
