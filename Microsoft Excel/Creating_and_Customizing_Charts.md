# Creating and Customizing Charts in Microsoft Excel

This guide explains how to create and format charts to visually represent your data in Excel.

## Creating a Chart

1. Select your data range (including headers).
2. Go to the Insert tab > Choose a chart type (Column, Line, Pie, Bar, etc.).
3. Excel inserts a default chart based on your selection.

## Customizing Your Chart

- Use the Chart Tools Design and Format tabs to adjust:
  - Chart title
  - Axis labels
  - Legend
  - Data labels
  - Colors and styles

## Choosing the Right Chart Type

- **Column/Bar**: Compare values across categories.
- **Line**: Show trends over time.
- **Pie**: Show parts of a whole (limited to one data series).
- **Scatter**: Show relationships between two variables.

## Moving and Resizing

- Click and drag the chart to move it.
- Use the corner handles to resize.

## Best Practices

- Avoid clutterâ€”less is more.
- Always label axes and include a clear title.
- Use contrasting colors for clarity.
