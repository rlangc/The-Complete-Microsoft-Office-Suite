# Sharing and Delegating Mailboxes and Calendars in Microsoft Outlook

Microsoft Outlook enables seamless collaboration by allowing users to share their calendars and mailboxes with colleagues. These sharing and delegation features are especially useful in environments where assistants manage schedules or when multiple team members need access to a shared mailbox.

This guide covers how to share your calendar, delegate mailbox access, assign permissions, and effectively manage shared folders and meeting invites.

## 1. Sharing Your Calendar

### How to Share:
1. Navigate to the **Calendar** module
2. Click **Home > Share Calendar**
3. Select the calendar to share (if you have more than one)
4. Enter the email address of the person you want to share with
5. Choose the level of permission:
   - **Can view when I’m busy**
   - **Can view titles and locations**
   - **Can view all details**
   - **Can edit**
   - **Delegate**

6. Click **Send**

### Best Practices:
- Use **descriptive permissions** to control what others can see or do
- Share calendars with full details for team visibility
- Use **color categories** to enhance coordination

## 2. Opening a Shared Calendar

To view a colleague’s shared calendar:
1. Go to **Calendar > Add Calendar > Open Shared Calendar**
2. Enter the name or email address
3. Click **OK**

You’ll now see their calendar overlaid with your own.

> For Microsoft 365, shared calendars update in real-time.

## 3. Delegating Access to Your Mailbox or Calendar

Delegation allows someone else (such as an executive assistant) to manage your calendar and mailbox.

### How to Delegate:
1. Go to **File > Account Settings > Delegate Access**
2. Click **Add**
3. Choose a user from the address book
4. Set permission levels:
   - **None**, **Reviewer**, **Author**, or **Editor**
5. Check whether to send meeting-related emails to delegate only or both

Delegates can:
- Schedule meetings on your behalf
- Send emails as or on behalf of you (if granted)
- Access your Inbox, Sent Items, and Calendar

## 4. Shared Mailboxes

Shared mailboxes allow multiple users to send and receive email from a common address (e.g., support@company.com).

### How to Access a Shared Mailbox:
- If permissions have been assigned, it will automatically appear in your folder pane
- Otherwise, add it manually:
  1. Go to **File > Account Settings > Account Settings**
  2. Double-click your account > **More Settings > Advanced**
  3. Click **Add...** and type the shared mailbox name

### What You Can Do:
- Send email from the shared address
- Access shared folders and subfolders
- Use shared calendar and contacts

> Shared mailboxes do not require a separate license if under 50GB and accessed through licensed users.

## 5. Assigning Folder-Level Permissions

You can allow others to access specific folders in your mailbox (e.g., only your Inbox).

### To Share a Folder:
1. Right-click the folder (Inbox, Calendar, etc.)
2. Click **Properties > Permissions**
3. Click **Add** to select users
4. Choose permission level (e.g., Reviewer, Contributor, Editor)
5. Click **Apply**

## 6. Managing Meeting Invites as a Delegate

If you've been granted delegate access:
- Meeting invites sent to your manager will also arrive in your inbox (if configured)
- You can respond to, decline, or reschedule on their behalf
- Your name may appear in the From or Sent on Behalf of line

> Best practice: Maintain open communication with the calendar owner to avoid conflicts.

## Summary

Outlook’s calendar and mailbox sharing features enable structured collaboration in teams and support roles. Whether you’re assigning access to specific folders or fully delegating scheduling responsibilities, mastering these tools helps streamline communication, reduce scheduling conflicts, and centralize team coordination.
