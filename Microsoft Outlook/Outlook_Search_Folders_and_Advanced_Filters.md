# Outlook Search Folders and Advanced Filters

Outlook’s Search Folders and advanced filtering tools help users quickly locate and organize emails without physically moving or duplicating them. These dynamic tools are especially useful for managing large volumes of messages, monitoring specific senders or topics, and surfacing high-priority communications.

This guide explains how to create Search Folders, apply advanced filters, and use custom views and sorting logic to streamline your inbox and maintain visibility into the messages that matter most.

## 1. What Are Search Folders?

A **Search Folder** is a virtual folder that displays messages based on defined search criteria. The emails remain in their original location but are dynamically collected into the Search Folder view.

### Benefits:
- Automatically includes new emails that match your criteria
- Keeps your mailbox clean while surfacing specific content
- Ideal for monitoring flagged items, unread emails, or project keywords

## 2. Creating a Search Folder

### To Create:
1. In the **Mail** view, scroll down to **Search Folders** in the Folder Pane
2. Right-click and select **New Search Folder**
3. Choose from pre-defined options:
   - Unread Mail
   - Mail from Specific People
   - Categorized Mail
   - Flagged for Follow Up
   - Mail with Specific Words
4. Click **Choose...** to refine conditions (e.g., sender, subject, folder scope)
5. Click **OK**

> Tip: Name your folder clearly to reflect its purpose, such as “Client ABC Emails” or “High Priority Follow-ups.”

## 3. Creating a Custom Search Folder

If built-in templates don’t fit your needs, you can define custom rules:

1. In **New Search Folder**, scroll down to **Create a custom Search Folder**
2. Click **Choose**, give your folder a name
3. Click **Criteria...** to build logic using:
   - **Messages** (From, To, Subject, Keywords)
   - **More Choices** (Read status, Categories, Flags)
   - **Advanced** (Field-based custom conditions)

4. Optionally, click **Browse** to limit search scope to specific folders
5. Click **OK** to save

## 4. Using Advanced Filters

For targeted filtering in any folder (without Search Folders), use:

### Filter Email (Desktop):
- Click the **Filter Email** dropdown on the Home tab
- Select filters like:
  - Unread
  - Has Attachments
  - Categorized
  - This Week
- Or use **Search Tools > Advanced Find** for detailed logic

### Outlook Web:
- Use the **Search bar** and select filters by:
  - Folder
  - Sender
  - Date
  - Has attachments
  - Keywords

> Tip: Type operators like `from:`, `subject:`, `hasattachments:yes` directly into the search bar.

## 5. Sorting and Custom Views

Customize how results display by using sorting and view settings:

- Click column headers (e.g., **From**, **Received**, **Size**) to sort
- Use **View > View Settings** to:
  - Add columns
  - Group by categories or flags
  - Apply conditional formatting (e.g., bold unread messages)

> Saved custom views can be reused across folders for consistency.

## 6. Best Practices

- Use Search Folders to monitor priority clients, projects, or flagged tasks
- Combine **Rules** with **Search Folders** for powerful automation
- Regularly review and refine your criteria to match evolving needs
- Avoid overloading with too many Search Folders—prioritize the most useful
- Name folders descriptively and nest them in logical hierarchies

## Summary

Search Folders and advanced filters in Outlook offer efficient ways to surface, track, and interact with email content without cluttering your folder structure. Whether you're scanning unread messages, tracking project communication, or surfacing follow-ups, these dynamic tools help maintain focus and improve workflow efficiency.
