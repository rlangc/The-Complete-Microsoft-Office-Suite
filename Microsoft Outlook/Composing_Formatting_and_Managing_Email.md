# Composing, Formatting, and Managing Email in Microsoft Outlook

Email remains the backbone of professional communication, and Outlook provides a robust set of tools to help users write, format, send, and manage messages efficiently. This guide walks through the essentials of composing well-structured emails, applying consistent formatting, attaching files, managing drafts, and organizing your inbox effectively.

Whether you're responding to client messages, scheduling follow-ups, or sending reports, mastering these tools ensures clear and professional communication.

## 1. Composing a New Email

### Steps to Create:
- Click **New Email** from the Home tab in Mail view
- Fill in the following fields:
  - **To**: Primary recipients
  - **Cc**: Carbon copy (secondary recipients)
  - **Bcc**: Blind carbon copy (hidden recipients)
  - **Subject**: Clear and concise topic
  - **Body**: Message content

### Tips:
- Use a professional greeting and closing
- Keep emails focused with one clear purpose
- Summarize key points in bullets when possible

## 2. Formatting Your Message

Use Outlook’s formatting tools to make messages easier to read and more visually consistent.

| Formatting Option | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Font** | Change typeface, size, color |
| **Bold / Italic / Underline** | Emphasize text (`Ctrl + B/I/U`) |
| **Bullets / Numbering** | Structure lists clearly |
| **Paragraph Alignment** | Align text (left, center, right, justify) |
| **Styles** | Apply predefined heading or body styles |
| **Clear Formatting** | Remove all styles from selected text |

> Access these options in the **Message** tab under the **Basic Text** group.

## 3. Attaching Files and Items

Outlook allows you to attach files, emails, calendar events, or OneDrive documents to any message.

### Attach a File:
1. Click **Attach File** in the ribbon
2. Choose from:
   - Recent items
   - Browse This PC
   - Browse Web Locations (OneDrive, SharePoint)

### Insert Other Items:

- Use **Insert > Picture** to embed images into the email body

> **Tip:** Files over 20MB may be automatically converted into OneDrive links.

## 4. Draft Management

Outlook auto-saves messages as drafts as you type.

- Unsent messages appear in the **Drafts** folder
- To continue editing:
  1. Go to the **Drafts** folder
  2. Double-click the draft message
  3. Make edits and click **Send**

> Best practice: Save long or detailed responses as drafts periodically to prevent loss.

## 5. Spell Check and Proofing

Avoid embarrassing typos with Outlook's built-in proofing tools.

- **AutoCorrect** corrects common spelling and punctuation errors automatically
- Use `F7` to run a **spelling and grammar check**
- Configure proofing settings under:
  `File` > `Options` > `Mail` > **Spelling and Autocorrect**

> **Tip:** Enable “Always check spelling before sending” to catch last-minute errors.

## 6. Email Management Tools

### Flagging

- Customize categories from `Home` > `Tags` > **Categorize** > **All Categories**

### Folders
- Move or drag emails into custom folders
- Right-click **Inbox** > **New Folder** to create organizational structure

## 7. Sending and Resending

### Send Options:
- Click **Send** to deliver immediately
