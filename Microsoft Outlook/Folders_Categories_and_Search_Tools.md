# Folders, Categories, and Search Tools

Organizing your inbox is key to maintaining productivity in Microsoft Outlook. This guide introduces best practices for managing email using folders, color-coded categories, flags, and Outlook’s powerful search tools. Whether you’re dealing with a few dozen messages or thousands, these features will help you stay in control.

## Using Folders to Organize Email

Folders allow you to manually or automatically sort email messages for better visibility and reduced clutter.

### Creating Folders
- Right-click on your inbox or any existing folder > **New Folder**
- Name your folder and press Enter

### Moving Messages
- Drag and drop emails into folders
- Use **Move to Folder** from the ribbon to relocate selected messages

### Tips:
- Create a folder structure by topic, project, or sender
- Use subfolders to keep related messages together (e.g., `Clients > Client A`)

## Color Categories and Custom Labels

Color categories provide a visual way to group and identify related messages, calendar events, or tasks.

### Assigning Categories
- Right-click a message > **Categorize** > Choose a color or **All Categories**
- Use the **Tags** group on the ribbon to assign categories quickly

### Customizing Categories
- In **All Categories**, you can rename categories, assign shortcut keys, and create new ones

### Use Cases:
- Red = Urgent
- Blue = Client-related
- Green = Internal Projects

## Flags and Follow-Up

Flags are used to mark messages that require future attention.

### Flag Options
- Hover over a message and click the flag icon for follow-up
- Right-click the flag to set a reminder or mark the message as complete

### View Follow-Ups
- Go to the **Tasks** pane or click **To-Do List** to review all flagged items

## Search Tools and Filters

Outlook offers advanced search functionality that can help locate emails using keywords, filters, and saved criteria.

### Basic Search
- Use the **Search bar** above your message list
- Outlook searches the current folder by default, but you can expand to **All Mailboxes**

### Search Filters
- Click inside the search bar to reveal the **Search Tools** tab
- Use filters like:
  - **From:** a specific person
  - **Subject:** contains certain words
  - **Has Attachments**
  - **Date Range**

### Search Operators (Advanced)
- `from:"John Smith"` – find emails from John Smith  
- `subject:project` – find emails with “project” in the subject  
- `hasattachments:yes` – find emails with attachments  

## Creating Search Folders

Search Folders are virtual folders that show dynamic results based on saved search conditions.

### How to Create
- Right-click **Search Folders** > **New Search Folder**
- Choose built-in options (e.g., “Mail with attachments”) or create a custom one

### Why Use Search Folders?
- View all flagged messages across folders
- Aggregate unread mail
- Monitor specific senders or categories

By combining folders, categories, flags, and advanced search techniques, Outlook users can maintain an organized inbox and respond quickly to high-priority messages.
