# Integrating Outlook with Microsoft Teams and OneNote

Outlook integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Teams and OneNote to provide a connected, collaborative productivity ecosystem. This guide walks you through how to schedule Teams meetings directly from Outlook, link OneNote for note-taking, and use shared Microsoft 365 Group calendars for streamlined scheduling and coordination.

These integrations are designed to reduce context switching, improve meeting preparation and follow-up, and ensure that notes, tasks, and communications remain centralized.

## 1. Scheduling Microsoft Teams Meetings in Outlook

With the Teams add-in enabled in Outlook (automatically installed with Microsoft Teams), you can create and manage Teams meetings directly from your calendar.

### To Schedule a Teams Meeting:
1. Go to the **Calendar** view in Outlook
2. Click **New Teams Meeting** from the toolbar (under the Home tab)
3. Add attendees, date, time, and meeting title
4. Include any agenda notes or documents in the body
5. Click **Send**

> Outlook will generate a join link for the meeting, allowing attendees to access it via the Teams app or browser.

### Additional Tips:
- Use **Scheduling Assistant** to find optimal meeting times
- Set recurring meetings for regular check-ins
- Teams meetings auto-sync with the Teams app calendar

## 2. Adding OneNote for Meeting Notes

You can organize meeting notes and action items by linking OneNote to calendar events or emails in Outlook.

### Option 1: Link OneNote to a Calendar Meeting
1. Open the meeting in Outlook
2. Click **Meeting Notes** on the ribbon
3. Choose to take notes:
   - **Your own notes**
   - **Share notes with the meeting**
4. Select the appropriate OneNote notebook and section

> The notes will be timestamped and linked to the meeting for future reference.

### Option 2: Send an Email to OneNote
1. Open any email message
2. Click **Send to OneNote** in the ribbon
3. Choose destination notebook and section

## 3. Using Microsoft 365 Group Calendars

When using Outlook with Microsoft 365 Groups (e.g., Teams-connected groups), shared calendars allow everyone in the group to view and manage team events.

### Access a Group Calendar:
1. In Outlook (desktop or web), go to **Calendar**
2. Under “Groups,” select the group name
3. View or add events to the group calendar

### Benefits:
- Meetings added to group calendars appear in Teams as well
- Visibility into team-wide schedules
- Shared responsibility for event management

## 4. Best Practices for Integrated Use

- Use **OneNote sections** for recurring meetings to track notes consistently
- Create a dedicated **Teams channel tab** for shared OneNote notebooks
- Add a OneNote link to the meeting invite body so attendees can prepare ahead of time
- Use **Group Calendars** for team-wide events, leave personal calendar for individual planning
- Review all action items in OneNote after meetings to drive follow-ups

## Summary

Integrating Outlook with Microsoft Teams and OneNote creates a collaborative workflow that supports meeting planning, note-taking, and calendar management. By leveraging these tools together, users can streamline productivity, maintain organized records of discussions and actions, and ensure all team members stay aligned within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.
