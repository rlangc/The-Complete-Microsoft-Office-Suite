# Contacts and the People Module in Microsoft Outlook

The People module in Outlook acts as your digital address book, allowing you to manage contact information, build professional networks, and create custom groups for streamlined communication. Whether you're connecting with clients, coordinating internal teams, or organizing personal relationships, the Contacts feature helps maintain up-to-date, accessible records linked directly to your emails and calendar.

This guide explains how to effectively manage individual contacts, create contact groups, integrate people into meetings and mail, and leverage Outlook’s People module for relationship management.

## 1. Accessing the People Module

To open the People view:
- In Outlook (desktop), click the **People** icon in the navigation bar at the bottom
- In Outlook Web App (OWA), select **People** from the app launcher

## 2. Adding a New Contact

You can create contacts manually or automatically from received emails.

### Manually:
1. Go to **People** > **New Contact**
2. Fill out fields:
   - Name
   - Email address
   - Company
   - Phone number(s)
   - Notes or details
3. Click **Save & Close**

### From an Email:
- Right-click the sender's name in an email
- Select **Add to Outlook Contacts**
- Edit and save the new contact

## 3. Creating and Managing Contact Groups

Contact Groups (formerly known as Distribution Lists) allow you to send emails or meeting invites to multiple people simultaneously.

### To Create a Group:
1. Go to **People** > **New Contact Group**
2. Name the group (e.g., “Marketing Team”)
3. Click **Add Members**:
   - From Outlook Contacts
   - From Address Book
   - New Email Contact
4. Click **Save & Close**

> Use groups for department updates, team meetings, or event coordination.

## 4. Viewing and Organizing Contacts

- **Sort and filter** by first name, company, or recently added
- Use **Categories** to group contacts (e.g., clients, vendors, internal teams)
- Use the **Search bar** to quickly locate individuals

> Pro Tip: Pin frequent contacts to your favorites for easy access.

## 5. Integrating Contacts with Email and Calendar

- When composing a new email or meeting, start typing a contact’s name to auto-complete from saved People
- Use **Schedule a Meeting** directly from a contact card
- View a contact’s **recent emails, shared files, and meeting history** in Outlook (Microsoft 365 accounts)

## 6. Contact Linking and Rich Profiles

For enterprise accounts:
- Outlook links contacts with shared organization data (e.g., reporting hierarchy, Teams availability)
- **Contact cards** display detailed presence information, job title, and recent activity
- Integration with **LinkedIn** or **Microsoft Delve** may populate richer profiles

## 7. Importing and Exporting Contacts

Use import/export tools to migrate contacts or back up information.

### Import:
- Go to `File` > `Open & Export` > **Import/Export**
- Choose **Import from another program or file**
- Select source (e.g., CSV)

### Export:
- Select **Export to a file** > **Comma Separated Values**
- Choose the Contacts folder
- Save to your desired location

## 8. Best Practices

- Regularly update contact info to ensure accuracy
- Merge duplicates to keep your address book clean (`People` > `Manage > Clean up contacts`)
- Add notes to contact records about key interactions or preferences
- Create groups for recurring teams or client lists
- Back up your contacts periodically for safety

## Summary

Outlook's People module simplifies managing contacts and communication at scale. From creating detailed contact profiles to building efficient distribution groups, users can maintain better control of their network, personalize communication, and enhance productivity. With deeper integration into email, calendar, and collaboration tools, mastering this module is key to staying organized and connected.
