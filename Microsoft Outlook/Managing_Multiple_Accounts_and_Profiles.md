# Managing Multiple Accounts and Profiles in Microsoft Outlook

Microsoft Outlook supports the management of multiple email accounts and user profiles, enabling users to keep work, personal, and specialized communications separate while accessing all of them within a single application. Whether you're toggling between organizational and private accounts or managing shared inboxes, Outlook provides powerful tools to simplify the experience.

This guide covers how to add and remove accounts, create separate profiles, and manage them effectively across desktop, web, and mobile versions of Outlook.

## 1. Adding Multiple Email Accounts

Outlook supports most major email providers (Exchange, Microsoft 365, Gmail, IMAP, POP).

### Steps to Add an Account:
1. Go to **File > Account Settings > Account Settings**
2. Under the **Email** tab, click **New**
3. Enter your email address and password
4. Follow any prompts (e.g., authentication)
5. Click **Finish**

> Tip: You can add multiple accounts—Outlook will display each account with its own inbox and folder structure.

## 2. Managing Existing Accounts

To view, edit, or remove accounts:
- Navigate to **File > Account Settings > Account Settings**
- Under the **Email** tab:
  - Select an account to **Remove**
  - Click **Change** to adjust settings (e.g., server details or login)

### Default Account:
- Set a default “From” account for new messages via:
  `File > Options > Mail > Send messages > Always use default account`

## 3. Creating and Using Outlook Profiles

Outlook Profiles allow for complete separation of account configurations, signatures, rules, and cached content. Ideal for users who want to fully separate work and personal environments.

### Create a New Profile:
1. Close Outlook
2. Go to **Control Panel > Mail > Show Profiles**
3. Click **Add** and name your new profile
4. Add an account and complete setup
5. Choose profile behavior:
   - **Prompt for a profile to be used**
   - **Always use this profile**

> Each profile operates independently with its own settings and storage.

## 4. Switching Between Profiles

If you've enabled Outlook to prompt for a profile:
- Close and reopen Outlook
- A dialog box will appear allowing you to select a profile

If not, you can change the default profile by:
- **Control Panel > Mail > Show Profiles > Always use this profile**

## 5. Mobile and Web Considerations

### Outlook Mobile:
- Supports multiple accounts, but no profile switching
- Accounts remain signed in and accessible via swipe/tap toggling

### Outlook Web App (OWA):
- Supports **Linked Mailboxes** under a single login
- Use **Add Shared Mailbox** or **Open Another Mailbox** for Exchange accounts
- Switch between identities via the user avatar in the top-right corner

## 6. Best Practices

- Use **profiles** when sharing a PC or separating secure contexts
- Use **multiple accounts in a single profile** when you want unified access
- Assign **distinct signatures** per account for clarity
- Name profiles clearly (e.g., "Work_2025", "Personal_Gmail")
- Back up profile settings and PST/OST files when transferring devices

## Summary

Managing multiple accounts and profiles in Outlook helps users stay organized, avoid context-switching errors, and support both professional and personal communication in a single tool. Whether you need to separate environments entirely or just manage different inboxes in one view, Outlook provides flexible options to accommodate your workflow preferences.
